## Business Problem

One of our customers wants to change their advertising bidding method from "Maximum Bidding" to "Average Bidding".

Does this change make sense considering sales?

## Dataset

Control Group - The dataset formed by using "Maximum bidding"

Test Group - The dataset formed by using "Average bidding"


## Variables

Impression : Ad impressions

Click : Number of clicks on the displayed ad

Purchase : The number of products purchased after the ads clicked

Earning: Earnings after purchased products
